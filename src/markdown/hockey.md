# Talk Title:

Automating Hockey Team Management with Serverless

## Talk Abstract:

You probably don't manage a beer league hockey team, maybe you do, I don't know your life but I'm sure you have a number of tasks that you do regularily that would benefit by being automated.

Follow me on my journey of realizing I could make my life easier by automating the the process of managing my hockey team. Calculating whether or not it would be worthwhile to expend the effort. Hilariously under estimating how long it would take but being super happy with the results. Along the way I'll explain serverless concepts like FaaS, triggers, cloud databases and single page applications.
